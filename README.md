# 🧑‍💼 HR Analytics Dashboard | Tableau Project

This project explores HR data to identify patterns in employee attrition, job satisfaction, and workforce demographics. It was built using Tableau as part of my data analyst portfolio, simulating a real-world business reporting task.

---------

## 📌 Project Objective

The objective was to support a fictional HR team in **diagnosing critical workforce issues** and crafting better retention strategies. The client (HR Manager) specifically requested a **data-driven summary of workforce pain points** in three key areas:

1. **Attrition Trends**
2. **Employee Satisfaction**
3. **Workforce Composition**

This dashboard simulates how a data analyst would approach a real HR request, combining data cleaning, exploration, and storytelling through Tableau.

## 🧩 Why the Dashboard Was Divided into 3 Key Sections

To meet the client’s needs effectively, I split the dashboard into three analytical parts — each designed to answer a specific business question:

### 1. 📉 **Attrition Trends**  
**Why are employees leaving?**  
We explored employee exit rates by department, age, education, and job roles to uncover which groups were most at risk of leaving and why.

### 2. 😊 **Employee Satisfaction**  
**Who’s most/least satisfied — and why?**  
We compared satisfaction scores against job levels, departments, and years of service to identify potential morale issues in specific teams.

### 3. 👥 **Workforce Demographics**  
**What does the workforce look like?**  
This section focused on gender balance, education background, marital status, and department distribution — helping HR evaluate representation and hiring gaps.

By structuring the dashboard this way, I ensured each part aligned with a **real HR decision-making need**, making the visuals both insightful and actionable.

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Highest Attrition:** The Sales department had the highest turnover, especially among younger staff (under 30) with low job satisfaction.
- **Job Satisfaction:** Technical roles showed the lowest satisfaction scores, particularly in the 3–5 years experience group.
- **Gender Imbalance:** Some departments showed strong skew toward male employees, suggesting potential bias or hiring imbalances.
- **Education Impact:** Employees with Life Sciences or Technical degrees had slightly higher attrition, raising questions about job fit or role engagement.
